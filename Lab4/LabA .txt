LabA 
a not retrieved automatically, is lazily loaded, needs @Transaction to fetch Employee, or EAGER
b book_publisher table doesn't seem to be getting populated with @JoinTable defaults, but

LabB

Retrieving order from the database needs to use @Transactional, otherwise connection gets
closed and lazy loaded relations (order line) can't be retrieved anymore.
